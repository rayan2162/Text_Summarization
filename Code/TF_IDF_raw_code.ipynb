            "D0 : A breed of venomous snake considered an endangered species in Bangladesh even a decade ago has made a full-fledged comeback in the northern and southeast parts of the country, wreaking havoc on public life.The snake, Russell’s viper or Chandrabora in Bengali vernacular, is the most venomous snake in Bangladesh. A viper’s bite can spread poison throughout the body and cause various physical symptoms, including loss of control of limbs, continuous bleeding, blood clots, nerve damage, paralysis, and kidney damage. Locally say that urbanisation in the northern part of the country nearly wiped out Russell’s viper a decade ago. However, since 2012, people in the countryside of Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj, as well as in the Rajbari, Faridpur, Kushtia and Patuakhali districts, have spotted fully-grown Russell’s vipers and snakelets in their farmland and sometimes, even in their households. Dr Md Abdul Wahed Chowdhury, co-investigator of the Venom Research Centre, Bangladesh, or VRC, has a theory about why this particular breed of snake is proliferating again.\n",
            "D1 : A series of stories have been making rounds on social media, of people dying in different parts of Bangladesh from the bite of the Russell's viper, a venomous snake. In these stories, many circulated by different media outlets, it's claimed that unlike most snakes, this one is hell-bent on biting people and even gives chase to do so. Articles and videos try to establish that the Russell's viper is not native to Bangladesh but is rather slithering its way here from neighbouring countries. Apparently, the snake, which disappeared from the country at one point, has proliferated and is targeting farmers in the fields, and the available antivenoms can barely cure 20 percent of people. So naturally, people are now in fear of getting attacked by the viper. In many areas, monetary rewards are being declared to kill the snake, which has unfortunately led to people beating pythons to death, mistaking them for the viper. Amid this mass panic, it has become imperative to verify such information, as many of the facts being circulated fall in the realm of misinformation.\n",
            "D2 : All health centres and hospitals in Bangladesh have been ordered to stock anti-venom after reports of a surge in snake bites across the country. Health Minister Dr Samanta Lal Sen also urged the public to bring snake bite victims to hospitals as soon as possible. Hospitals in rural Bangladesh have reported an increase in people being bitten by snakes, especially by the Russell's viper, which is found in South Asia. The incidents have been a major topic on Bangladeshi social media in recent weeks. As it feeds on rodents, the Russell's viper is often found near human settlements, and in farmland particularly during harvest season. A 2023 study said about 7,000 people die in Bangladesh every year from snake bites. Most victims survive if treated with anti-venom quickly. The Russell's viper was declared extinct in Bangladesh in 2002 but the species has now returned. Scientists believe the snake, which usually lives found in dry areas, has adapted to different climate conditions, and has now spread to more than 25 districts in Bangladesh.\n",
            "D3 : One of the deadliest snakes on the Indian subcontinent is growing increasingly common in Bangladesh, spurring questions about the country’s preparedness to deal with venomous snakes in general. Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii) is responsible for nearly half of snakebites in neighboring India, but in Bangladesh, where it’s known as chandra bora, it was thought to be an exceedingly rare species for more than a century. That changed in 2013, however, when a flurry of snakebite cases, many of them fatal, began to be reported, with most of those killed farmers working in their fields. A 2018 study recorded 20 deaths due to Russell’s viper bites between 2013 and 2016, and identified reports of bites from this species in 17 of Bangladesh’s 64 districts. It attributed the snake’s “booming” population to improvements in irrigation systems, which allowed farmers to cultivate crops on their fields throughout the year, instead of only for part of the year as previously. That means that rats, the viper’s prey of choice, are also present in the fields year-round, where they feed on the crops.\n",
            "D4 : The deaths caused by the bites of the deadly venomous Russell's Viper, commonly known as 'Chandrabora' in Bangla, are increasing alarmingly in all districts under the Kushtia region, specially, in the districts surrounded by the rivers and farmlands. A viper's bite can spread poison throughout the body and cause various physical symptoms, including loss of control of limbs, continuous bleeding, blood clots, nerve damage, paralysis, and kidney damage.\n"
