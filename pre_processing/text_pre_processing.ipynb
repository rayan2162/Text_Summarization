Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units, such as words, subwords, or characters.\n","\n","2. Normalization: Converting text to a standard form, including lowercasing, removing punctuation, accents, or diacritics.\n","\n","3. Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words (e.g., \"and\", \"the\", \"is\") that don't carry significant meaning.\n","\n","4. Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form by removing suffixes.\n","\n","5.  Lemmatization: Similar to stemming, but resulting in valid words (lemmas) through linguistic analysis.\n","\n","6.  Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to words in a sentence.\n","\n","7.  Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, locations, organizations) in text.\n","\n","8.  Chunking: Grouping consecutive words into \"chunks\" based on syntactic patterns.\n","\n","9.  Parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences, often represented as parse trees.\n","\n","10. Sentence Segmentation: Splitting text into individual sentences.\n","\n","11. Spell Checking: Correcting spelling errors in text.\n","\n","12. Text Normalization: Converting text into a canonical form, such as standardizing dates, numbers, or abbreviations.\n","\n","13. Removing HTML Tags: Stripping HTML markup from text documents.\n","\n","14. Removing URLs: Eliminating web URLs from text data.\n","\n","15. Removing Punctuation: Deleting punctuation marks from text.\n","\n","16. Removing Numeric Characters: Eliminating digits and numbers from text.\n","\n","17. Removing Special Characters: Deleting special characters, symbols, or non-printable characters.\n","\n","18. Removing Accents/Diacritics: Stripping accents or diacritical marks from letters.\n","\n","19. Removing Stopwords: Eliminating commonly occurring words that do not carry much semantic meaning.\n","\n","20. Lowercasing/Uppercasing: Converting text to lowercase or uppercase.\n","\n","21. Removing Whitespace: Stripping extra spaces, tabs, or line breaks from text.\n","\n","22. Text Expansion: Expanding contractions (e.g., \"don't\" to \"do not\").\n","\n","23. Text Compression: Contracting repeated characters or phrases (e.g., \"loooove\" to \"love\").\n","\n","24. Token Normalization: Standardizing tokens with similar meanings (e.g., \"USA\" to \"United States\").\n","\n","25. Removing Emoticons/Emoji: Eliminating emoticons or emoji from text data.\n","\n","26. Removing Short Words: Filtering out very short words or tokens.\n","\n","27. Removing Rare Words: Eliminating infrequently occurring words from text.\n","\n","28. Removing Duplicates: Deleting duplicate words or tokens from text.\n","\n","29. Text Augmentation: Generating synthetic text examples through techniques like synonym replacement, word swapping, or paraphrasing.\n","\n","30. Entity Masking: Replacing named entities with generic labels (e.g., replacing person names with \"PERSON\")."],"metadata":{"id":"HafyDkrVTj3f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0d2w7y_VtSnS"},"source":["## Stpes done here\n","1.
