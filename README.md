# Extractive Text Summarization using TF-IDF

**Artificial Intelligence Laboratory course of the 6th semester's project.**

This project focuses on creating an extractive text summarization model using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to generate concise summaries from large textual datasets.
.

## Project Structure

### 1. Code Folder

- `tf_idf_built_in_function.ipynb`: Implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm using built-in Python functions.
- `tf_idf_raw_code.ipynb`: Manual implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm from scratch.

### 2. Final Report Folder

- `Images Folder`:
  - `output.png`: The output of the summarization process.
  - `process_flow.png`: A visual representation of the process flow.
- `ai_lab_final_report`: The final report available in `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.zip` formats for **LaTeX**.

### 3. Preprocessing Folder

- `Generated Text Data Folder`:
  
  - `bangladesh_small.txt`: Sample text data used in the project.
- `text_pre_processing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for preprocessing text data.
- `web_scraper.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for scraping text data from the web.

### 4. Presentation Folder

- `final_presentation.pptx`: The final presentation for the project.

### 5. Project Proposal Folder

- `ai_proposal_cover`: The cover page of the project proposal in `.docx` and `.pdf` formats.
- `ai_proposal_main`: The main content of the project proposal in `.docx` and `.pdf` formats.

### 6. Reference Materials

- `reference_pdf.zip`: A collection of research papers and other reference materials for convenience.

**Note:** The  `reference_pdf.zip` file contains some research papers that were downloaded in PDF format for convenience and were used for this project.

- These PDFs and materials may be subject to copyright.
- I do not own these materials nor do I have permission to distribute them.
- They are provided solely for educational purposes, to facilitate access to reference papers.

## How to Use

1. **Code Execution:**
   - The code for the project is located in the `Code` folder.
   - Use `tf_idf_raw_code.ipynb` to explore the raw implementation.
   - Use `tf_idf_built_in_function.ipynb` for a version using built-in functions.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The `Preprocessing` folder contains the scripts used to clean and preprocess the text data. 
   - `text_pre_processing.ipynb` handles text data cleaning.
   - `web_scraper.ipynb` is used to scrape data from web sources.

3. **Final Report:**
   - The `Final Report` folder contains the final documentation of the project.
   - You can find `output.png` and `process_flow.png` in the `Images` folder.
   - The final report is available in `.docs`, `.pdf`, and `.zip` (for **LaTeX**) formats.

4. **Presentation:**
   - The `Presentation` folder includes `final_presentation.pptx` which summarizes the project for presentations.

5. **Project Proposal:**
   - The `Project Proposal` folder contains the proposal documents in both `.docx` and `.pdf` formats.

## Example Usage

```text
Enter size of your summary: 3

3 lines sized summary:

Sentence: Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) is responsible for nearly half of snakebites in neighboring India, but in Bangladesh, where itâ€™s known as chandra bora, it was thought to be an exceedingly rare species for more than a century.
Sentence: Hospitals in rural Bangladesh have reported an increase in people being bitten by snakes, especially by the Russell's viper, which is found in South Asia.
Sentence: A series of stories have been making rounds on social media, of people dying in different parts of Bangladesh from the bite of the Russell's viper, a venomous snake.
